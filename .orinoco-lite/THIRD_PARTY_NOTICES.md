# Presentation notices

Maintainers copy the presentation assets required by downstream builds into
`materialized-presentation/upstream/` at their original upstream-relative
paths. The adjacent `materialized-presentation/LICENSE` applies to that bounded
ordinary-file overlay. Applicable notices are preserved in the overlay when it
is populated.

The complete reusable website, its projection templates, and its theme are not
copied into this scaffold. The selected Orinoco Lite package resolves them at build
time and preserves notices supplied by their dependency closure, including
Congo's MIT notice.
