description: Run a downstream's site-owned Orinoco Lite metadata adapter executables against site-owned source configuration and evidence with explicit human decisions. Use when capturing source snapshots, generating candidate changes, reviewing accept/reject/defer choices, updating compact durable decision state, applying decisions, opening adapter pull requests, checking provenance, or determining whether local locks or newer upstream behavior governs. Do not use for ordinary editorial or asset work.

# Operate Orinoco metadata adapters

Treat an adapter run as a human-reviewed curation workflow.
A clean command, valid record, or plausible match is evidence, not permission to change accepted metadata.

## Resolve the site's contract

1. Read every applicable `AGENTS.md`, the site README, ownership manifest, `pixi.lock`, the applicable `site-specific/sources/<id>/source.yaml`, adapter README, tests, and site-owned policy or decision registers.
2. Confirm that the checkout is a released downstream and the adapter lives under `extensions/source-adapters/<adapter>/`.
   The thin template does not include generic adapter executables.
3. Follow the consumer's locked release and the adapter's local contract.
   Remote latest is advisory until a reviewed framework update changes the lock.
4. If the task asks about new upstream behavior, verify the authoritative remote and compare it with the local pin.
   Label supported, current-upstream, and proposed behavior separately.
   Do not treat an issue or pull request as merged.
5. Check the human-review queue before generating or applying identity, eligibility, venue, topic, relationship, or other ambiguous semantics.

Do not assume this skill's workflow means the site already implements a generic decision-file schema.
Follow the adapter's tested local format.
Escalate missing shared machinery as an Orinoco Lite engineering change.

## Keep each state in its authority

- Store accepted Things and supported assertion provenance in the site's canonical metadata records.
- Store captured source content, evidence, and mapping policy under `site-specific/sources/<id>/`.
  Store durable human dispositions under `site-specific/curation-records/`.
  This is decision memory, not an evictable cache.
- Keep source-response caches, lookup indexes, temporary reports, browser output, generated projections, and builds ignored.
- Use Git or DataLad to record execution and content history.
  Do not expect a Git diff alone to explain why an absent record was rejected.
- Keep semantic mappings distinct from operational matches and review dispositions.
  If both Things and SSSOM forms exist, use the locally declared canonical authority and generate the other.

Read [adapter-review.md](references/adapter-review.md) in full before recording decisions, applying a review bundle, or preparing an adapter pull request.

## Run the review transaction

1. Start from a clean, current review branch in the downstream repository.
2. Capture or select the declared source snapshot and run the adapter's exact documented command from `extensions/source-adapters/<adapter>/`.
   Keep literal project-relative arguments in the execution record and run that extension's own tests before a network-backed refresh.
3. Review candidate identities, assertions, provenance, collisions, unresolved items, and the effect of prior decisions.
   Do not auto-create or fuzzy-link an ambiguous entity.
4. Present each unresolved choice to the human as an atomic decision with evidence, consequences, and a recommendation clearly labeled as such.
5. Record only the human's explicit accept, reject, link, defer, or supersede choice, including the scope and rationale required by local policy.
6. Run the adapter's decision-application command.
   Attach the supported PAV or statement-level provenance to accepted assertions without fabricating human authorship for machine-generated content.
7. Run local validation, adapter tests, deterministic or idempotence checks, and any focused rendered review required by the site.
8. Re-read the final diff and ensure every candidate is handled or visibly pending.
   Validate again after the last decision change.

When every candidate is rejected, prepare and preserve a decision-only pull request for human review and merge if local policy allows.
Closing the proposal, deleting an inbox item, or leaving no metadata diff does not record the decisions.

## Prepare human review

Keep source capture distinct from semantic curation when the adapter contract requires separate changes.
Otherwise prefer one review pull request that ends with both explicit decision state and the metadata application, so the branch is self-consistent.

In the pull-request summary, identify:

- base revision, source snapshot, adapter and policy versions, and literal run command;
- records or assertions proposed, accepted, linked, rejected, deferred, or superseded;
- stale decisions or materially changed proposals returned to review;
- ambiguous or unresolved items and the human choices still required;
- metadata, provenance, mapping, rendered-site, and idempotence checks run;
- whether the diff is decision-only.

A bot may copy an explicit human choice into the review branch or open a decision-only fallback pull request.
It must not infer a choice from comments, labels, silence, closure, or absence; approve; merge; or deploy.
Require human review of the latest pushed head.

Use `$manage-orinoco-content` for ordinary editorial and asset work.
Use `$develop-orinoco-lite`, when available in the engineering workspace, for package, schema, shared adapter-contract, or upstream-adoption changes.
