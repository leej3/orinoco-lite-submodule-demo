# Getting started

1. Set the site identity and canonical public URL in `site-specific/site.yaml`.
2. Replace the starter records and `/explore` page with reviewed site metadata and editorial content before publishing.
3. Add further editorial pages, assets, and static inputs only under their `site-specific/` directories.
4. Run `pixi run build`; it validates the inputs as part of building the site.
5. Configure repository Pages and curation settings before enabling hosted editing.

Orinoco Lite supplies the default projection and resolves the presentation selected by its packaged resources.
Ordinary site construction should use declarative inputs and the supported small overrides under `site-specific/overrides/`, not copy the upstream presentation into this repository.

Use `pixi run orinoco-lite validate` to check inputs without generating a site or projection, and `pixi run orinoco-lite verify-site build/site` to check an existing local build without rebuilding it.
Builds reuse unchanged metadata projections; `pixi run build --no-cache` repeats projection and semantic checks without fetching new source data.

For GitHub Pages, `pixi run build-pages` builds the website and emits its publication bundle from clean committed inputs.
The workflow deploys the site, then runs `publication record` to retain that successful build outside the source branch.
There is no separate preparation step and no rebuild after deployment.

The template's required materialized presentation assets are ordinary files under `.orinoco-lite/materialized-presentation/upstream/`.
Site-specific assets belong under `site-specific/`; downstream tasks never hydrate either tree with Git Annex.

Metadata acquisition and curation programs may live under `extensions/` and run through explicit adapter tasks.
They must write proposals or reviewed metadata inputs; the website build never imports or executes them.
