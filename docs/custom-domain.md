# Custom domain and secure GitHub submission

Orinoco Lite keeps editing on this deployed site.
The central curation service supplies only the GitHub App authentication and submission boundary; it does not host a second editor, review page, landing page, or copy of the site's presentation inputs.

## Choose the browser origin

A dedicated custom domain is the normal, low-friction configuration.
On that origin, `/edit/` and `/review/` can offer **Propose via GitHub** without a shared-origin warning.
**Download bundle** always remains available without GitHub authentication or a curation-service request.

GitHub project sites at `OWNER.github.io/REPOSITORY/` share the browser origin `https://OWNER.github.io` with every other path published on that host.
Browsers isolate origins, not URL paths, so `/REPOSITORY/edit/` cannot prove that another same-origin page is a different application.
Orinoco Lite therefore shows a clear warning on a shared `*.github.io` host.
The SHACL `/edit/` route does not require a checkbox or acknowledgment before **Propose via GitHub**.
The source-adapter `/review/` route retains its separate acknowledgment before posting curation decisions.

The curation service still revalidates the repository, installation, user permission, pull request, commits, and allowed paths.
The warning explains the remaining browser-origin limitation rather than replacing those server-side checks.

## Add and verify a GitHub Pages custom domain

Use a hostname dedicated to this trusted site, then follow these steps:

1. Verify the domain for the owning GitHub account or organization before attaching it to the repository.
Follow GitHub's [domain-verification procedure](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/verifying-your-custom-domain-for-github-pages) and keep the verification TXT record in DNS.
2. In the site's repository, open **Settings → Pages**, add the custom domain, and save it before pointing DNS at GitHub Pages.
3. Configure the required DNS record with the domain provider by following GitHub's [custom-domain guide](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site).
Do not use a wildcard DNS record.
This template publishes with GitHub Actions, so it neither needs nor tracks a `CNAME` file.
4. Wait for GitHub's DNS and certificate checks to succeed, then enable **Enforce HTTPS** using GitHub's [HTTPS procedure](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/securing-your-github-pages-site-with-https).
5. Set `identity.base_url` in `site-specific/site.yaml` to the exact canonical HTTPS URL, including any path and a trailing slash.
Commit that identity change and let the Pages workflow deploy it.

For a GitHub Actions Pages deployment, repository settings are authoritative for the custom domain.
A tracked `CNAME` file is ignored and is not a substitute for those settings.

## Verify the deployed behavior

After the Pages workflow succeeds:

1. Open the deployment URL reported by GitHub and confirm that it redirects, if necessary, to the exact HTTPS custom domain recorded in `identity.base_url`.
2. Open the deployed `/edit/` route and confirm **Download bundle** works before signing in.
3. Confirm the shared-`github.io` warning is absent and **Propose via GitHub** can start the GitHub App popup normally.
4. Open `/review/` from a real source-review link and confirm it remains on the same custom origin throughout review and submission.

If the page is still served from `*.github.io`, do not suppress the warning in site configuration.
**Download bundle** remains the credential-free alternative to direct GitHub submission.

## Use a self-hosted curation service

The central Orinoco Lite service at `https://orinoco-curation-review.pages.dev` is used when `site.curation_service` is absent; do not repeat that default in site configuration.
To replace only that backend, add its credential-free HTTPS origin to `orinoco.yaml`:

```yaml
site:
  curation_service: https://curation.example.org
```

Do not add repository identity beside it.
The Pages build continues to derive that identity from the trusted GitHub Actions context.
Use the engineering repository's [GitHub App deployment skill](https://github.com/ORINOCO-Lite/orinoco-lite-dev/tree/main/.agents/skills/orinoco-github-app-deployment) to configure the replacement service, its GitHub App callback, exact downstream-origin checks and binding, and deployment verification.
